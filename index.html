    <p>Hello, I have long hair and a very energetic dog named Bug. 
        I solve problems and put out fires all day and naturally found a love for coding.
        I was born in Flint, MI and grew up around there. I am a musician and I've played in various Rock and Metal bands.
        I tend to keep to myself mostly but very much enjoy good conversation and team building.

    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <div class="p1">
    <p>I began my coding journey in High School on CodeAcedemy working through the basics of HTML and CSS.
        I would spend hours in class coding - moving from module to module and I absolutely loved it.
        After High School I attempted to major in video game development but the curriculum was more desgin/art based and I lost interest quickly.
        Recently I've started up a business with my brother and I handle operations of everything and one of my many tasks is to build landing pages and sales pages.
        With the increasing fun I was experiencing I knew my only option was to pursue this career right away.
    </p>
    <p>Thus leading me down my search of endless bootcamps and reading countless reviews. 
        This is when a friend told me to check out Grand Circus. So I did.
        I quickly gained intrigue with perusing the website and scheduled a call.
        My 1:1 with Rachel was so enjoyable and it really solidified my want to be here.
        I stopped all communications with every other bootcamp I had and made my decision to enroll.
        I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me at Grand Circus and I am confident it will be a very bright one.
